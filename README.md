Here's the updated `README.md` file, which includes details on the new `autoBenchmark.py` utility. You can download and use this file for your project.

### `README.md`

```markdown
# pyMountS3

A CLI application to configure and mount S3 storage using Rclone. This application reads settings from a `.env` file, allows you to install `rclone`, configure it, and provides commands to mount and unmount your S3 storage. Additionally, it includes a utility to benchmark and optimize the performance of your mounted S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Conda (Anaconda or Miniconda)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyMountS3.git
cd pyMountS3
```

### 2. Set Up Conda Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
conda create --name pyMountS3 python=3.10
conda activate pyMountS3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create and Configure `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with your settings. You can use the provided `.env.example` as a template.

```env
# S3 Storage Settings
IPADDR=your_ip
WEB_USER=your_user
PASSWORD=your_password
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
MOUNT_POINT=/mnt/myswarm
```

### 4. Install Rclone

The CLI includes a command to install `rclone`:

```bash
python pyMountS3.py install
```

## Usage

### Configure Rclone

Configure `rclone` with the S3 settings from your `.env` file:

```bash
python pyMountS3.py configure
```

### Mount the S3 Bucket

Mount your S3 bucket to the specified mount point:

```bash
python pyMountS3.py mount
```

### Unmount the S3 Bucket

Unmount the S3 bucket:

```bash
python pyMountS3.py unmount
```

## Benchmarking and Optimization

The project includes a utility to benchmark and optimize the performance of your mounted S3 bucket.

### 1. Install Benchmarking Tools

Install `fio` for benchmarking:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y fio
```

### 2. Create Benchmark Script

Create a `benchmark.fio` file with the following content:

```ini
[global]
directory=/mnt/swarm/firstbucket
ioengine=libaio
direct=1
size=1G
bs=4k

[write_test]
rw=write
name=write_test
numjobs=4
group_reporting

[read_test]
rw=read
name=read_test
numjobs=4
group_reporting
```

### 3. Run the Benchmark Utility

Run the `autoBenchmark.py` script to benchmark and optimize the performance:

```bash
python autoBenchmark.py
```

This script will test various configurations and output the performance metrics.
